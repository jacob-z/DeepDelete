# DeepDelete

Ever had to share a flash drive with Windows users and it returns with virus files in every possible subdirectory?  DeepDelete can be used to remove these files from all those subdirectories automatically.  DeepDelete is meant to expedite this process and save you hours of searching and deleting all those malicious files.  THIS IS NOT ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE.  Users must specify which files they want to delete from which directory, DeepDelete does not search for any "known" malicious files.
